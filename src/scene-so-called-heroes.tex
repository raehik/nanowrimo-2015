\section{So called 'heroes'}

On their travels, the pair crossed through uncountable little hamlets and
settlements. The road was busy... etc.

``All these houses remind me of an amusing tale about a 'hero' who would steal
from villagers.'' said Gorn. He turned to Trixie to ask if she cared much for
stories, and her eager smile told him what he needed.

``Very well. Let's see...''

``Once many generations ago, a righteous hero roamed these lands, aiding those
who cried out for help, resolving issues of crucial to minute importance with
equal efforts made. He was respected across the realm for his great deeds of
kindness -- but he swore to live humbly, travelling without rest in order to
make any difference he could to the good people of the world.''

``But there were rumours that the hero was a fellow of questionable morals in
person. Some who saw him in their village said that instead of walking, he would
roll between places, often bowling people over with nary a word spoken. (Indeed
he seemed to rarely speak at all!) According to others, he would scream and run
at trees to shake leaves down -- yet every time he did, gold coins would land in
front in him, as if he were rehearsing an arcane ceremony to obtain wealth!''

``And,'' he whispered, leaning in close (as did Trixie, who was captivated),
``I had an encounter with him once, during my early years in the army

``Hah hah hah hah! Just kidding.'' etc.
