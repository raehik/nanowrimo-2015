"G'morn..."

Many a time, in this small village of Pettle and in other cities far and wide
across the land, had there been girls as depressed as the one girl who sat
currently on the side of the road. Many a time throughout the world's history
had there been such world-weary retired veterans as the one now making his way
between the winding houses of the quaint Pettle.

Many a time, such people had seen each other, acknowledged one another, maybe
even spoken to the other if it was a nice day and the sun was shining bright and
moods were more sincere than normal. Even before had those people grown to like
the other and, for one reason or another, travel with them to far-away places
and live wondrous adventures and daring escapes.

But as much as those people may have tried, not one ever had adventures such as
the ones our two to-be-companions ended up having. What began as a misunderstood
greeting evolved into a strong and rather unlikely relationship.

"What?" said a well-built, greying man. He shook his head to move a few strands
of knotted hair from in front of his eyes. Silver-white hair extended from his
scalp to his shoulder on all sides apart from most of his forehead. He fixed a
hard, but tired gaze on what he considered the offending party -- the girl (a
beggar, no doubt) who had greeted him.

"Oh, um, good morning to you, mister, um... sir." The girl scrambled for words,
not expecting a reply and quite honestly half-asleep. She was sitting slightly
lopsided with no surface to rest her back on, an empty basket lined with white
cloth laying to her side. Her messy dirt-brown hair was less well-maintained
than the man's, though a similar length. As she spoke, she looked up at the
towering man in front of her, then whipped back her head down, fearful of his
penetrating gaze.

"Who are you to know my name?" questioned the man, still maintaining a rather
intimidating stare.

"Yo-your name? I don't know your name." The girl looked up at the man.

"You just called it now."

"But I just s-said good'morn."

"Oh." The man fell silent for a moment. The girl noticed that his cheeks were
reddened. She lost her fear of the man and turned her head upwards to get a
proper view of him.

Now that an exchange had begun, both of them looked at the other properly for
the first time. The man noted many immediate features about the girl.

The most obvious was her terribly short hair, which appeared to have been cut
recently, and most definitely not washed for weeks. Thin blades of grass stuck
out of the front half of her head. Some parts of her hair were straight, some
were all tangled up with each other. Then her large blue eyes met his and he
suddenly felt very nostalgic, though he couldn't think why. The girl's face was
round and there were creases around her mouth, as if she smiled constantly
(clearly today was the exception). Her clothes were ragged, yet hardly marked
from dirt. He noted that she was thin, but not incredibly so.

The girl was eyeing the man at the same time. She wondered at his rare silver
hair, gawped at his visible scars, stared at his strong arms. His appearance was
of a normal person on who time had run its course; but then she noticed an
insignia on his upper arm. It was shaped like a shield with a cross in the
middle and a spear pointing upwards through the centre. Her eyes widened and her
mouth opened as she recalled what it meant.

"You're a soldier!" she exclaimed.

"Long past are those days. I prefer to spend my time sitting in front of my
fire, simply relax--"

"You! You can help me! Can you--can I come with you back to your house?"

The girl's request was absurd, he knew. He prepared a short reply, then faltered
as he began to speak. The girl was looking intently at him, with sparkling eyes
and pleading hands. He knew not what she wanted, nor who she was -- and yet as
he paused he found it harder and harder to reject the seeming beggar girl. But
she was not begging for a positive answer, merely asking, hoping that her honest
request could be fulfilled. He was reminded of another girl, from another life:
one he had loved, one he could never let go of. His eyes drifted, then came back
and looked around the girl, but not directly at her.

"I suppose I would have nothing against it. Come along if you must." he said,
trying to sound as reluctant for the idea as he could.
