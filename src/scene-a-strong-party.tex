``So you're a... gungs-man?'' Trixie always felt silly trying to say new words.

``Gunsmith,'' corrected Gorn with a slight tut, ``and I should add a mighty good
one at that. The army decided giving me a sword was an exercise in time wasting,
so I was proffered a gun and told to learn how it worked.''

``A 'gun'?... Was that the metal thing that you were wearing in the portrait? It
looked like two rods of metal and wood put together.''

``Ohoh, they are much, much more amazing than that! When I learned how to use
one, they were only being tested in a few cities, since most places consider
researching magic a better use than developing guns. Even now they are just as
rare, since they take a certain skill to use. That is a skill I most definitely
have!'' He laughed heartily to himself and continued. ``You want me to show you
the gun in action, yes? Here, this clearing should make it easy to see.'' He
pointed yonder a few yards to a circle of ground covered in a foot of leaves and
enclosed on most sides by trees. They diverted from the trail, Trixie making
sure to throw up leaves with every step.
